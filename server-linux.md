To configure WireGuard to route traffic to a specific network (in this case, `192.168.10.0/24`) on the server side, you need to edit the WireGuard configuration file for the server. Below is an example of what the configuration might look like:

### Example WireGuard Server Configuration (`wg0.conf`)

```ini
[Interface]
# The private key for the server
PrivateKey = <server-private-key>
# The public IP address and port the server will listen on
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820

# If you want to enable IP forwarding on the server
PostUp = sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT
PostUp = iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o <external-interface> -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT
PostDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o <external-interface> -j MASQUERADE

[Peer]
# The public key of the client
PublicKey = <client-public-key>
# The allowed IPs include the client's IP and the network you want to route
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32, 192.168.10.0/24
```

### Key Points:
1. **[Interface] Section**:
   - `PrivateKey`: The server's private key.
   - `Address`: The IP address assigned to the WireGuard interface on the server. This is typically a private IP, e.g., `10.0.0.1/24`.
   - `ListenPort`: The port on which the WireGuard server listens for incoming connections.

2. **IP Forwarding**:
   - `PostUp`: Commands executed when the interface comes up. It enables IP forwarding and sets up NAT to allow clients to access the broader internet or other networks.
   - `PostDown`: Commands executed when the interface goes down. It disables IP forwarding and cleans up the NAT rules.

3. **[Peer] Section**:
   - `PublicKey`: The public key of the client.
   - `AllowedIPs`: Specifies which IP addresses are allowed to use the tunnel. Here, `10.0.0.2/32` is the IP assigned to the client, and `192.168.10.0/24` is the network the client is allowed to route through the VPN.

### After Configuring:
1. **Restart WireGuard**: Apply the configuration by restarting the WireGuard interface.
   ```bash
   wg-quick down wg0
   wg-quick up wg0
   ```

2. **Client Configuration**: Ensure the client has a corresponding route for `192.168.10.0/24` through the VPN.

This setup allows the WireGuard server to route traffic for the `192.168.10.0/24` network to the client, assuming that network is accessible from the server.
